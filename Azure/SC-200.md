# SC-200: Security Operations Analyst Associate (Skills measured as of October 21, 2024) Study Guide  

## Foreword  

I originally created this study guide for my own SC-200 preparation but decided to share it to help others study more efficiently. While Microsoft Learn and the official documentation are great resources, I found that they weren’t always structured in a way that made it easy to see how each topic mapped to the exam objectives. Some key concepts felt buried in long explanations, while others seemed disconnected from the technical documentation.

To make studying more effective, I structured this guide to focus on what actually matters for the exam, linking relevant Microsoft documentation where needed. My goal is to provide a clear, concise reference that makes navigating the material easier.

If you find this guide helpful and want to support my work, you can buy me a coffee ☕️!
