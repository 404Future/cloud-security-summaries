	- Files (Hashes) â€“ Block execution, remediation, audit, warn, allow.
	- IP Addresses, URLs/Domains â€“ Same as files.
	- Certificates â€“ Allow or block & remediate only.
- Key Considerations:
	- 15,000 indicator limit per tenant.
	- Blocking via file hashes not recommended for apps (use WDAC or AppLocker).
	- Network protection blocks access after TCP handshake completes.
	- IoC enforcement depends on Defender settings & configured actions.

ðŸ“Œ  Source: [Set up and configure Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 1 - Microsoft Defender for Endpoint | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/mde-p1-setup-configuration#configure-web-content-filtering)

Enforcement & Detection Engines
- Cloud Detection Engine: 
	- Scans data for IoC matches, enforcing defined actions.
- Endpoint Prevention Engine: 
	- Applies Defender AV policies for alerts & blocks.
- Automated Investigation & Remediation: 
	- Overrides verdicts based on IoC settings.

Best Practices & Limitations
- Use least privilege roles (avoid Global Administrator unless necessary).
- Prefer IP/URL indicators over file hashes for web access control.
- Microsoft Store apps cannot be blocked via Defender.
- Defender for Cloud Apps can override Defender portal IoC settings.
- Some alert types (e.g., block indicators) generate informational alerts only.

	- Limited visibilityâ€”only detects devices seen in existing network traffic.
- Standard Discovery (Active) â€“ Recommended
	- Uses multicast queries and active probing to find more devices.
	- Provides enriched device information.
	- Default mode since July 19, 2021.

Device Inventory & Onboarding Status
- Onboarded: 
	- Device is managed by Defender for Endpoint.
- Can be onboarded: 
	- Detected and supported but not yet onboarded.
- Unsupported: 
	- Detected but not supported by Defender for Endpoint.
- Insufficient info: 
	- Requires standard discovery for more details.

Network Device Discovery
- Uses authenticated remote scans (agentless) via Defender for Endpoint sensors.
- Discovers routers, switches, firewalls, WLAN controllers, VPN gateways.

Advanced Hunting for Unmanaged Devices
- Find discovered devices

```
DeviceInfo
| summarize arg_max(Timestamp, *) by DeviceId  
| where isempty(MergedToDeviceId)  
| where OnboardingStatus != "Onboarded"
```
  
- Identify which onboarded device detected them

```
DeviceInfo
| where OnboardingStatus != "Onboarded"
| summarize arg_max(Timestamp, *) by DeviceId  
| where isempty(MergedToDeviceId)  
| limit 100  
| invoke SeenBy()  
| project DeviceId, DeviceName, DeviceType, SeenBy
```

- Analyze network connections from non-onboarded devices

```
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where ActionType == "ConnectionAcknowledged" or ActionType == "ConnectionAttempt"
| take 10
```

Defender for IoT Integration
- Extends discovery to OT and Enterprise IoT devices (e.g., VoIP, printers, smart TVs).
- Works via Microsoft Defender for IoT in Defender portal.

Security Recommendations & Vulnerability Management
- Found under Defender Vulnerability Management > Security Recommendations.
- Helps prioritize onboarding and securing high-risk unmanaged devices.
