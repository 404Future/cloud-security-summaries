	- Modify via Portal â†’ Usage & estimated costs â†’ Data Retention â†’ Adjust slider.  
	- API: Set retention & enable `immediatePurgeDataOn30Days` for strict 30-day compliance.  

- Table-Level Retention (custom per-table settings):  
	- Portal: Log Analytics workspaces â†’ Tables â†’ Manage table.  
	- Interactive: Set 4 - 730 days (Analytics tables).  
	- Total: Up to 12 years (CLI/PowerShell currently supports only 7 years).  

### Retention Modifications & Impact  
- Shortening retention:
	- 30-day grace period before deletion.  
- Increasing retention:
	- Applies immediately to existing & new data.  
- Long-term retention activation:
	- Interactive data transitions automatically.  

### Log Deletion & Special Table Handling  
- Azure Tables:
	- Cannot be deleted; stop data ingestion instead.  
- Custom Log Tables (`_CL`):
	- Soft-deleted until retention period expires.  
- Search Results Tables (`_SRCH`):
	- Deleted immediately when removed.  
- Restored Tables (`_RST`):
	- Cache removed, source data remains.  

### Permissions for Managing Retention  
| Action | Required Permission | Built-in Role |  
|-----------|----------------------|------------------|  
| Configure default retention | `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/write` | Log Analytics Contributor |  
| Get table retention settings | `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/tables/read` | Log Analytics Reader |  

### Pricing Considerations  
- Retention costs depend on data volume (GB) Ã— retention period (days).  
- Log data with `_IsBillable == false` is not charged (e.g., some system logs).

## Plan and configure Syslog and Common Event Format (CEF) event collections

### Overview
- Objective: Integrate Syslog and CEF messages into Microsoft Sentinel using the Azure Monitor Agent (AMA).

### Key Concepts
- Syslog: Standard protocol for transmitting log messages across network devices.
- Common Event Format (CEF): Vendor-neutral log format designed for security information and event management (SIEM) systems.
- Azure Monitor Agent (AMA): Collects and forwards Syslog and CEF messages to Microsoft Sentinel.
- Data Collection Rule (DCR): Defines the log sources and types of messages to collect.

### Setup Process
1. Install the Appropriate Solution:
   - From the Microsoft Sentinel Content hub, install the Syslog or Common Event Format solution. 
2. Create a Data Collection Rule (DCR):
   - Navigate to Microsoft Sentinel > Configuration > Data connectors.
   - Select 'Syslog via AMA' or 'Common Event Format (CEF) via AMA' connector.
   - Click '+Create data collection rule'.
   - Provide a name, select subscription, and resource group.
   - Define log sources and specify log levels.
3. Install Azure Monitor Agent (AMA):
   - AMA is automatically installed on selected Linux machines during DCR creation.
4. Configure Syslog Daemon on Log Forwarder:
   - Set up 'rsyslog' or 'syslog-ng' to listen on TCP/UDP port 514 (or preferred port).
   - Ensure configuration matches the application's log transmission settings.
5. Configure Security Devices or Appliances:
   - Set devices to send logs in CEF or Syslog format to the log forwarder's IP and designated port.

### Best Practices
- Avoid Data Duplication:
   - Use separate facilities for Syslog and CEF messages.
   - Adjust Syslog configuration on source devices to prevent overlapping log facilities. 
- Secure Log Transmission:
   - For devices sending logs over TLS, configure the Syslog daemon to support TLS communication.
- Monitor and Maintain:
   - Regularly review DCRs and AMA configurations to ensure continuous log collection.
