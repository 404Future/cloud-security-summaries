## Configure Microsoft Sentinel roles

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Microsoft Sentinel  
- Microsoft Sentinel uses Azure RBAC to manage permissions.  
- Assign roles at resource group level for full Sentinel resource access or at workspace level (requires additional assignments).  

### Built-in Microsoft Sentinel Roles  
| Role                          | Key Permissions                                      |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Sentinel Reader            | View data, incidents, workbooks.                    |
| Sentinel Responder         | Manage incidents (assign, dismiss, etc.).           |
| Sentinel Contributor       | Install/update content, create/edit workbooks, analytics rules. |
| Sentinel Playbook Operator | Run playbooks manually.                             |
| Sentinel Automation Contributor | Allows Sentinel to run playbooks in automation rules. |

### Other Related Roles  
| Role                  | Purpose                                      |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Logic Apps Contributor  | Create, edit, and run playbooks.         |
| Workbook Contributor    | Create and delete workbooks.             |
| Azure Contributor       | Grants broad permissions across Azure, including Sentinel. |

### Role Assignment Best Practices  
- Assign roles at the resource group level to cover all Sentinel-related resources.  
- Use custom roles when built-in roles donâ€™t meet specific needs.  
- To grant playbook execution permissions, Sentinel needs the Automation Contributor role at the playbookâ€™s resource group level.  
- Guest users need Directory Reader + Sentinel Responder to assign incidents.  

### Resource-Specific RBAC (Granular Access)  
- Table-Level RBAC:
	- Restrict access to specific data types.  
- Resource-Context RBAC:
	- Assign permissions based on the data users need, without full Sentinel access.

## Specify Azure RBAC roles for Microsoft Sentinel configuration

### Custom Roles & Advanced RBAC  
- Custom Roles:
	- Create Azure custom roles for Sentinel & Log Analytics permissions.  
- Log Analytics RBAC:
	- Use table-level RBAC and resource-context RBAC to restrict access to specific data without full Sentinel access.  

### Role Assignment Best Practices  
| User Type             | Role | Resource Group | Permissions |
|----------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Security Analysts | Sentinel Responder | Sentinel RG | View & manage incidents. |
|                      | Playbook Operator | Sentinel RG or Playbook RG | Attach & run playbooks. |
| Security Engineers | Sentinel Contributor | Sentinel RG | Manage incidents, create/edit workbooks & analytics rules. |
|                      | Logic Apps Contributor | Sentinel RG or Playbook RG | Modify & run playbooks. |
| Service Principal | Sentinel Contributor | Sentinel RG | Automate Sentinel management tasks. |

### Resource-Based Access Control  
- Use resource-context RBAC for users needing access to specific data (e.g., Windows event logs).  
- Instead of granting full Sentinel access, restrict access to only necessary resources.

## Design and configure Microsoft Sentinel data storage, including log types and log retention 

### Log Retention Overview  
- Interactive Retention (default: 30 days, extendable to 730 days for Analytics tables).  
- Long-term Retention (low-cost storage, up to 12 years, searchable via search jobs).  
- Default Retention:  
	- Most tables â†’ 30 days interactive retention.  
	- Log tables (e.g., Usage, AzureActivity) â†’ 90 days free retention.  

### Managing Data Retention  
- Workspace-Level Retention (affects all Analytics tables unless overridden):  
	- Modify via Portal â†’ Usage & estimated costs â†’ Data Retention â†’ Adjust slider.  
	- API: Set retention & enable `immediatePurgeDataOn30Days` for strict 30-day compliance.  

- Table-Level Retention (custom per-table settings):  
	- Portal: Log Analytics workspaces â†’ Tables â†’ Manage table.  
	- Interactive: Set 4 - 730 days (Analytics tables).  
	- Total: Up to 12 years (CLI/PowerShell currently supports only 7 years).  

### Retention Modifications & Impact  
- Shortening retention:
	- 30-day grace period before deletion.  
- Increasing retention:
	- Applies immediately to existing & new data.  
- Long-term retention activation:
	- Interactive data transitions automatically.  

### Log Deletion & Special Table Handling  
- Azure Tables:
	- Cannot be deleted; stop data ingestion instead.  
- Custom Log Tables (`_CL`):
	- Soft-deleted until retention period expires.  
- Search Results Tables (`_SRCH`):
	- Deleted immediately when removed.  
- Restored Tables (`_RST`):
	- Cache removed, source data remains.  

### Permissions for Managing Retention  
| Action | Required Permission | Built-in Role |  
|-----------|----------------------|------------------|  
| Configure default retention | `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/write` | Log Analytics Contributor |  
| Get table retention settings | `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/tables/read` | Log Analytics Reader |  

### Pricing Considerations  
- Retention costs depend on data volume (GB) Ã— retention period (days).  
- Log data with `_IsBillable == false` is not charged (e.g., some system logs).
