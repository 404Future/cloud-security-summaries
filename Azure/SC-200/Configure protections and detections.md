2. **Create a New Policy:**
   - Select **Create policy** and choose the desired policy type (e.g., Access policy, Activity policy).
   - Fill in policy details such as name, description, and specific conditions.
3. **Define Policy Conditions:**
   - Set filters and conditions based on user groups, app types, activities, or file properties.
4. **Set Actions and Alerts:**
   - Determine the actions to take when a policy is violated, such as sending alerts or restricting access.
5. **Save and Monitor:**
   - Save the policy and monitor its effectiveness through the policy management dashboard.

**Best Practices:**

## Configure policies for Microsoft Defender for Office 365

**Overview**
- Microsoft Defender for Office 365 provides preset security policies to streamline the implementation of recommended security settings. These presets, namely Standard and Strict, are designed to safeguard your organization against various threats.

**Preset Security Policies**
- **Standard Preset Security Policy**:
  - Offers balanced protection suitable for most organizations.
  - Applies recommended settings for anti-phishing, anti-spam, and anti-malware.
- **Strict Preset Security Policy**:
  - Provides enhanced protection for high-risk environments.
  - Implements more aggressive threat mitigation settings.

**Configuring Preset Security Policies**
1. **Access the Microsoft Defender Portal**:
   - Navigate to Defender portal.
   - Go to **Email & Collaboration** > **Policies & Rules** > **Threat policies** > **Preset Security Policies**.
2. **Assign a Preset Security Policy**:
   - Select **Standard protection** or **Strict protection**.
   - Click on **Manage protection settings** to initiate the configuration wizard.
3. **Define Recipients**:
   - Choose to apply the policy to **All recipients** or **Specific recipients**.
   - For specific recipients, specify users, groups, or domains.
4. **Review and Apply**:
   - Verify the configuration settings.
   - Click **Confirm** to apply the policy.

**Additional Considerations**
- **Policy Hierarchy**:
  - Preset security policies take precedence over custom policies.
  - If both Standard and Strict policies are applied, the Strict policy settings override the Standard ones.
- **Exclusions**:
  - It's possible to add exclusions, but it's generally not recommended as it may reduce protection effectiveness.
- **Monitoring and Adjustments**:
  - Regularly monitor the impact of these policies.
  - Adjust assignments as necessary to maintain optimal security without hindering productivity.

## Configure security policies for Microsoft Defender for Endpoints, including attack surface reduction (ASR) rules

**Overview**
- **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)**: A comprehensive endpoint security solution offering advanced threat protection and attack surface reduction.

**Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) Rules**
- **Purpose**: Mitigate threats by restricting actions and behaviors commonly used by malware.
- **Configuration Methods**:
  - **Endpoint Security Policy (Preferred)**:
    - Navigate to **Endpoint Security > Attack surface reduction** in the Microsoft Intune admin center.
    - Create or select an existing policy.
    - For new policies, choose **Attack Surface Reduction Rules** as the profile type.
    - Configure desired ASR rules.
    - Assign the policy to target devices or groups.
  - **Device Configuration Profiles (Alternative)**:
    - Go to **Device configuration > Profiles** in Intune.
    - Create a new profile with **Endpoint protection** as the profile type.
    - Configure ASR rules under the **Microsoft Defender Exploit Guard** section.
    - Assign the profile to appropriate devices or groups.

**Best Practices**
- **Audit Mode Evaluation**:
  - Initially deploy ASR rules in audit mode to assess potential impacts.
  - Monitor audit logs to identify legitimate applications that might be affected.
  - Adjust rules or create exclusions based on findings.
- **User Notifications**:
  - Configure notifications to inform users when content is blocked by ASR rules.
  - Provide options for users to unblock content if necessary.
  - Note: Some ASR rules may not support user override functionality.
- **Advanced Hunting**:
  - Utilize advanced hunting queries in the Microsoft Defender portal to analyze ASR rule events.
  - Focus on unique processes per hour to streamline data analysis.
- **Platform Support**:
  - Ensure devices run supported versions of Windows (e.g., Windows 10 Pro version 1709 or later) for ASR rule applicability.
  - Verify that Windows Server versions are onboarded correctly to support ASR features.

## Configure and manage custom detection rules

**Overview**
- Custom detection rules in Microsoft Defender XDR allow proactive monitoring of events and system states, including suspected breach activities and misconfigurations. These rules, based on advanced hunting queries, run at regular intervals to generate alerts and initiate response actions upon detecting matches. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

**Prerequisites**
- **Permissions**: To manage custom detections, ensure you have one of the following roles:
  - Security settings (manage)
  - Security Administrator
  - Security Operator (with 'Manage Security Settings' permission if RBAC is enabled)
- These roles grant the necessary permissions to create and manage detection rules within the Microsoft Defender portal.

**Creating a Custom Detection Rule**
1. **Prepare the Query**:
   - Navigate to the Advanced Hunting section in the Microsoft Defender portal.
   - Select or craft a query that identifies the desired events or system states.
   - Run the query to validate its accuracy and ensure it returns appropriate results.
   - Ensure the query includes the following columns:
     - `Timestamp`
     - Columns that uniquely identify the event, such as `DeviceId` and `ReportId` for Defender for Endpoint tables.
2. **Define Rule Details**:
   - With the validated query, select 'Create detection rule'.
   - Specify the following alert details:
     - **Detection name**: A unique identifier for the rule.
     - **Frequency**: Interval at which the query runs (e.g., every 15 minutes, hourly).
     - **Alert title**: The title displayed for alerts triggered by this rule.
     - **Severity**: The potential risk level associated with the detected activity.
3. **Select Impacted Entities**:
   - Identify the columns in your query results that represent the main affected entities.
   - This step aids in aggregating relevant alerts, correlating incidents, and targeting response actions effectively.

**Managing Custom Detection Rules**
- **View Rule Details**:
  - Navigate to 'Hunting' > 'Custom detection rules' in the Microsoft Defender portal.
  - Select a rule to view its general information, run status, scope, and a list of triggered alerts and actions.
- **Modify or Run Rules**:
  - From the rule's details page, you can:
    - Edit the rule's configuration.
    - Manually run the rule.
    - Enable or disable the rule.
    - Delete the rule if it's no longer needed.

**Best Practices**
- **Optimize Queries**:
  - Refine queries to minimize false positives and avoid generating alerts for routine activities.
  - Each rule is limited to generating 100 alerts per run; ensure queries are specific to maintain relevance.
- **Regular Review**:
  - Periodically assess and update detection rules to align with evolving security threats and organizational changes.
- **Collaborate Across Teams**:
  - Work with different security teams to ensure detection rules cover various threat vectors and organizational needs.

## Manage alerts, including tuning, suppression, and correlation

**Alert Tuning and Suppression**
  - **Purpose**: Reduce false positives and streamline alert management.
  - **Creating Suppression Rules**:
    - Select an alert to suppress.
    - In the alert management pane, choose "Create a suppression rule."
    - Define conditions based on alert title, indicators of compromise, or other attributes.
    - Specify actions and scope for the rule.
    - Regularly review and update suppression rules to ensure effectiveness.

**Alert Correlation**
  - **Function**: Aggregate related alerts into incidents for comprehensive analysis.
  - **Process**:
    - The correlation engine groups alerts from various sources.
    - Incidents are formed to provide broader context of attacks.
    - Continuous monitoring allows merging of incidents as new information emerges.

**Best Practices**
  - Regularly monitor and adjust suppression rules to adapt to evolving threats.
  - Utilize the correlation engine to understand the full scope of security incidents.
  - Engage with security operations teams to prioritize investigation and remediation efforts.
