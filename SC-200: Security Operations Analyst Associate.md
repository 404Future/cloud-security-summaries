# SC-200: Security Operations Analyst Associate (Skills measured as of October 21, 2024) Study Guide  

## Foreword  

When I first started studying for the SC-200 exam, I relied on Microsoft's official learning path and study guide. However, I quickly realized that the material wasnâ€™t always structured in a way that made it easy to see how each topic mapped to the exam objectives. Some key concepts felt buried in long explanations, while others seemed disconnected from the technical documentation.

To make studying more effective, I took a different approach. I used Microsoft Learn as my foundation but supplemented it with the official technical documentation, linking relevant articles directly to the exam objectives. This helped me focus on what actually mattered for the test while deepening my practical understanding of Defender XDR, Sentinel, and other security solutions.

This study guide is the result of that process. Itâ€™s a structured summary of what I learned, with direct references to Microsoftâ€™s documentation where needed. My goal is to make it easier for others to navigate the material, just like I wish I had when I started.

If you find this preview helpful, I offer full versions of my study guides on Patreon, where I go even deeper into the topics. But whether you use this guide alone or as a supplement, I hope it helps you prepare more efficiently and confidently for the exam.

- **Semi-Automation:** Approval needed for remediation in certain locations.
  - Variants:
    - All folders: Requires approval for all files.
    - Core folders: Only system-critical locations need approval.
    - Non-temp folders: Excludes temporary locations.
- **No Automation:** No automated remediation or investigation (not recommended).

#### Key Notes:
- Full automation removes 40% more threats than semi-automation.
- Defender for Business uses Full Automation by default.
- View all remediation actions in Action Center.
- Changes take effect instantly after updating settings.

# Identify unmanaged devices in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

## 1. Overview
Device discovery in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) identifies unmanaged devices in the network. Helps secure endpoints, network devices, and IoT assets by onboarding them to Defender for Endpoint.

## 2. Discovery Modes
- **Basic Discovery (Passive):** Uses SenseNDR.exe to collect network traffic data. Limited visibilityâ€”only detects devices seen in existing network traffic.
- **Standard Discovery (Active) â€“ Recommended:** Uses multicast queries and active probing to find more devices. Provides enriched device information. Default mode since July 19, 2021.

## 3. Device Inventory & Onboarding Status
- **Onboarded:** Device is managed by Defender for Endpoint.
- **Can be onboarded:** Detected and supported but not yet onboarded.
- **Unsupported:** Detected but not supported by Defender for Endpoint.
- **Insufficient info:** Requires standard discovery for more details.

## 4. Network Device Discovery
Uses authenticated remote scans (agentless) via Defender for Endpoint sensors. Discovers routers, switches, firewalls, WLAN controllers, VPN gateways.

## 5. Advanced Hunting for Unmanaged Devices
- Find discovered devices 

    DeviceInfo
    | summarize arg_max(Timestamp, *) by DeviceId  
    | where isempty(MergedToDeviceId)  
    | where OnboardingStatus != "Onboarded"

- Identify which onboarded device detected them 

    DeviceInfo
    | where OnboardingStatus != "Onboarded"
    | summarize arg_max(Timestamp, *) by DeviceId  
    | where isempty(MergedToDeviceId)  
    | limit 100  
    | invoke SeenBy()  
    | project DeviceId, DeviceName, DeviceType, SeenBy

- Analyze network connections from non-onboarded devices 

    DeviceNetworkEvents
    | where ActionType == "ConnectionAcknowledged" or ActionType == "ConnectionAttempt"
    | take 10

## 6. Defender for IoT Integration
Extends discovery to OT and Enterprise IoT devices (e.g., VoIP, printers, smart TVs). Works via Microsoft Defender for IoT in Defender portal.

## 7. Security Recommendations & Vulnerability Management
Found under **Defender Vulnerability Management > Security Recommendations**. Helps prioritize onboarding and securing high-risk unmanaged devices.
