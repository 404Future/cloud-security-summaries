# SC-200 Study Guide  

## Foreword  

When preparing for the **SC-200: Microsoft Security Operations Analyst** exam, I initially followed the **Microsoft Learn learning path** and the **official study guide**. However, I quickly realized that the content was not structured in a study-friendly wayâ€”it wasnâ€™t always clear which topics mapped to which exam objectives.  

To create a more effective learning experience, I turned to **Microsoft's technical documentation**. I reviewed the **exam objectives**, identified the relevant technical articles, and built my summary based on those resources. This approach ensured that each exam domain was covered with accurate and up-to-date information.  

In this study guide, I have linked the relevant **Microsoft Learn** documentation to each topic, making it easier to dive deeper into key concepts when needed. My goal is to provide a structured and efficient way to study for SC-200, focusing on the most relevant technical details.  

Hope this helps with your preparation!
